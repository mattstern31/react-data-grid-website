### Release process

For maintainers only.

- `cd` to the root of the repo.
- Checkout the `main` branch.
- Make sure your local branch is up to date, no unpushed or missing commits, stash any changes.
- Update the changelog, if necessary, and commit.
- Login to the `adazzle` npm account if you haven't already done so:
  - `npm login`
  - You can use `npm whoami` to check who you are logged in as.
