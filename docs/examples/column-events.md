Overview
-----
It is possible to subscribe individual columns to any [React Synthetic event](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html);
By adding an event object with callbacks for the native React events, you can bind events to a specific column. That will not break the default behaviour of the grid and will run only for the specified column.

Every event callback must respect this standard in order to work correctly: 

```javascript
function onXxx(ev :SyntheticEvent, (idx, rowIdx, rowId, column): args)
```
